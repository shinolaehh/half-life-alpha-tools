# shinola's modded alpha tools
a set of tools which have been modified and created to make mapping for the half-Life 0.52 alpha to be properly possible

# A POLITE ALL-CAPS NOTE
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS HEAVILY WORK IN PROGRESS AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME REQUIRES YOU TO GO INTO THE ALPHA'S WORLDCRAFT AND TO EXPORT THE MAP THERE DUE TO THE ALPHA COMPILERS PARSING MAPS DIFFERENTLY**

## tools
### modified existing tools
- **csg, bsp, vis, light, rad** - the compilers we all know and love!! hex-edited so it can work right out of the box, without setting up a specific directory layout **NOTE: PLEASE USE 'LIGHT' OVER 'RAD' AT THIS POINT IN TIME**
### newly created tools
- **alpha2goldsrc** - `.bsp` converter which makes 0.52 maps completely compatible with retail goldsource right out of the box
- **map2map** - `.map` converter which converts the zhlt / retail `.map` format to the alpha's `.map` format so it can be compatible with the modified compilers

## todo
- implement map2map
- add a proper lights.rad
