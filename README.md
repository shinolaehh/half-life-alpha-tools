# shinola's modded alpha tools
a set of tools which have been modified and created to make mapping for the half-Life 0.52 alpha to be properly possible

## tools
### modified existing tools
- **csg, bsp, vis, light, rad** - the compilers we all know and love!! hex-edited so it can work right out of the box, without setting up a specific directory layout **NOTE: PLEASE USE 'LIGHT' OVER 'RAD' AT THIS POINT IN TIME**
### newly created tools
- **alpha2goldsrc** - `.bsp` converter which makes 0.52 maps completely compatible with retail goldsource right out of the box
- **map2map** - `.map` converter which converts the zhlt / retail `.map` format to the alpha's `.map` format so it can be compatible with the modified compilers

## todo
- implement map2map
- add a proper lights.rad
